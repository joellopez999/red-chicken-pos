# Customer Verification Alternatives

> **Research / alternatives note — not a shipping decision.** Current product auth is **email/password** (see [0002-customer-features-plan.md](0002-customer-features-plan.md) for planned email verification). Do **not** implement SMS, Twilio, or OAuth from this document alone. Stars and “recommended” wording below compare research options to each other, not the current roadmap. OAuth design notes live in [0022-oauth-social-login-notes.md](0022-oauth-social-login-notes.md) (also not shipped).

## Overview
Alternatives to email verification for verifying customer identity and device ownership in a POS system.

## 1. Phone Number (SMS) Verification ⭐ **Preferred among research options for POS**

*(Research ranking only — not an accepted product decision; see banner above.)*

### How it works:
- Customer registers with phone number
- System sends SMS with verification code (6-digit)
- Customer enters code to verify
- Phone number becomes the primary identifier

### Pros:
- ✅ **Faster** - Most people check SMS immediately
- ✅ **More accessible** - Everyone has a phone, not everyone checks email regularly
- ✅ **Better for POS context** - Customers ordering at restaurant can verify quickly
- ✅ **Less spam risk** - Harder to create fake phone numbers than emails
- ✅ **Can be used for order notifications** - SMS order updates
- ✅ **Two-factor ready** - Phone can be used for MFA later

### Cons:
- ❌ **Cost** - SMS services cost money (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
- ❌ **International** - Different formats, some countries harder to verify
- ❌ **Privacy concerns** - Phone numbers are more sensitive than emails
- ❌ **Carrier issues** - Some carriers block SMS, delivery delays

### Implementation:
```python
# Services: Twilio, AWS SNS, Vonage, MessageBird
# Cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per SMS
# Libraries: twilio, boto3 (AWS SNS)
```

### Best for: **Restaurant POS systems** where speed matters

## 2. Social Login (OAuth) ⭐ **GOOD FOR UX**

### How it works:
- Customer clicks "Sign in with Google/Apple/Facebook"
- Redirects to provider, customer authorizes
- Provider verifies identity and returns to app
- Account automatically verified (provider already verified email/phone)

### Pros:
- ✅ **No verification step needed** - Provider already verified
- ✅ **Faster registration** - One click, no password needed
- ✅ **Better UX** - Users familiar with social login
- ✅ **More secure** - Password managed by Google/Apple
- ✅ **Email already verified** - If using Google, email is verified
- ✅ **Device trust** - Provider handles device verification

### Cons:
- ❌ **Dependency** - Relies on third-party services
- ❌ **Privacy** - Some users don't want to link accounts
- ❌ **Not universal** - Not everyone has Google/Apple account
- ❌ **Business context** - Some customers may not want to use personal accounts for business invoices

### Providers:
- **Google Sign-In** - Most common, good coverage
- **Apple Sign-In** - Required for iOS apps, privacy-focused
- **Facebook Login** - Less popular now, privacy concerns
- **Microsoft** - Good for business customers

### Best for: **Consumer-facing apps** where convenience matters

---

## 3. Magic Link (Passwordless) 🔗

### How it works:
- Customer enters email/phone
- System sends one-time link via email/SMS
- Customer clicks link (valid for 15-60 minutes)
- Automatically logged in, device trusted

### Pros:
- ✅ **No password** - One less thing to remember
- ✅ **Secure** - Link expires, single use
- ✅ **Device verification** - Link clicked on device = device owned
- ✅ **Simple UX** - Just enter email, click link

### Cons:
- ❌ **Still needs email/SMS** - Same delivery issues
- ❌ **Link sharing risk** - If email compromised, link can be shared
- ❌ **Requires email access** - Customer must check email/SMS

### Best for: **Passwordless authentication** systems

---

## 4. Device Fingerprinting + Behavioral Analysis 🔍

### How it works:
- Collect device characteristics (browser, OS, screen size, timezone, etc.)
- Track behavioral patterns (typing speed, mouse movements)
- Create device "fingerprint"
- Trust device after successful login pattern

### Pros:
- ✅ **No user action needed** - Transparent to user
- ✅ **Continuous verification** - Can verify throughout session
- ✅ **Fraud detection** - Unusual patterns detected

### Cons:
- ❌ **Privacy concerns** - Tracking behavior
- ❌ **Not 100% reliable** - Can be spoofed
- ❌ **Complex** - Requires ML/analytics
- ❌ **False positives** - Legitimate users flagged

### Best for: **Fraud prevention** (supplement, not primary)

---

## 5. CAPTCHA + Device Trust 🛡️

### How it works:
- Customer registers with basic info
- CAPTCHA verifies human (reCAPTCHA v3, hCaptcha)
- Device/browser characteristics stored
- Trust builds over time with successful orders

### Pros:
- ✅ **Simple** - No email/SMS needed
- ✅ **Bot protection** - Prevents automated accounts
- ✅ **Low friction** - Just solve CAPTCHA

### Cons:
- ❌ **Not identity verification** - Doesn't prove who they are
- ❌ **CAPTCHA fatigue** - Users hate CAPTCHAs
- ❌ **Can be bypassed** - Advanced bots can solve
- ❌ **No device ownership proof** - Anyone on device can use

### Best for: **Bot prevention** (supplement, not primary verification)

---

## 6. Phone Call Verification 📞

### How it works:
- Customer enters phone number
- System calls with verification code
- Customer enters code from call
- Phone verified

### Pros:
- ✅ **Works without SMS** - Good for landlines
- ✅ **More reliable** - Less likely to be blocked
- ✅ **Accessible** - Works for non-smartphone users

### Cons:
- ❌ **More expensive** - Calls cost more than SMS
- ❌ **Slower** - Takes longer than SMS
- ❌ **International** - Expensive for international calls

### Best for: **Backup method** when SMS fails

## 7. Hybrid Approach (Recommended) 🎯

### Combination Strategy:

**Tier 1: Quick Verification (Low Security)**
- Social login (Google/Apple) - Auto-verified
- Phone SMS - Quick verification
- Magic link - Passwordless option

**Tier 2: Enhanced Security (For Sensitive Operations)**

- Behavioral analysis
- Risk scoring
